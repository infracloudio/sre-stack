# RunWhen Local requires a kubeconfig to discover resouces from 1 or more

# Using inClusterAuth works for the local cluster only.

# cluster contexts to be discovered

### RunWhen Local Runtime Configuration
# autoRun: start discovery on deployment, and re-run discovery evey discoveryInterval seconds
# also supports upload configuration for continuous updates of RunWhen Platform Workspace
# upload is disabled by default; requires a valid uploadInfo.yaml
autoRun:
  discoveryInterval: 14400                 # seconds to wait until a new discovery
  uploadEnabled: false                     # upload configuration to RunWhen Platform
  uploadMergeMode: "keep-uploaded"         # 'keep-uploaded' or 'keep-existing'


# terminal: Enable or disable the in-browser terminal (unauthentication connection to container shell)
terminal:
  disabled: true

###### Upload configuration
# The upload configuration applies only to users to leverage RunWhen Local as an
# onboarding tool into RunWhen Platform (https://www.runwhen.com for more details)
# When uploading discovered resources and configuration information to RunWhen Platform,
# workspaceName, token, workspaceOwnerEmail, defaultLocation and papiURL are mandtatory
# can can be obtained immediately after creating a RunWhen Platform workspace.

uploadInfo:
  workspaceName: undefined
  token: undefined
  workspaceOwnerEmail: tester@my-company.com
  papiURL: undefined
  defaultLocation: undefined


###### workspaceInfo
# Currently this holds details such as custom variables & upload configuration
# Note: This section will soon be split into two separate configuration files
#
###### Custom Variables
# Custom variables are used to help tailor the generated content when we can't
# automatically infer from the discovered resources (such as specifying a prometheus
# provider, cloud provider, or kubernetes distribution & binary (mostly for oc vs
# kubectl users))
